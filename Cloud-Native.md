# How Cloud-Native Applications are Unique
Cloud-native applications and services differ from their legacy counterparts because they are specifically designed for the cloud from day one. They can be deployed and fixed faster, have a more fluid architecture, and can be placed and moved through different environments easily. Many companies are adapting their legacy applications that were built before the cloud to have cloud-native characteristics. Certainly, non-cloud-native applications have still been built after the cloudâ€™s rise to prominence, and will continue to be built in certain circumstances.
